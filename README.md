# ColterBayLights
R scripts and data for the paper: "National Park visitors perceive benefits for themselves and wildlife under blended red-white outdoor lighting."

This repository stores the code and data used to generate the results in the paper named above. These offer opportunities to replicate the results, and possibly explore other patterns in these data.

This R scripts use the R library _here_ to organize file access. Create a project directory containing three subdirectories: Data, Output, and Rcode (the last could be named anything). You must create an empty file ".here" in the top level (project) directory.
There are three R scripts:
GrteSocSciHeatmap4.R -- main script for processing
heatMkf6.R -- functions defined for the preceding file
ConsentChecks.r -- auxiliary analysis of differences between visitors who did or did not consent to participate in the survey.
The CSV, TXT, and XLXS files go in the Data subdirectory.

Questions about the survey design and deployment should be directed to Prof. Peter Newman at Penn State University -- pbn3@psu.edu.
